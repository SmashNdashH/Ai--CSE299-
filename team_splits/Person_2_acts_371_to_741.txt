Section 178:

(1) The provisions of this Part relating to the issue, effect, duration, renewal and cancellation of Bangladesh Load Line Certificates shall apply to ships other than Bangladesh ships as they apply to Bangladesh ships subject to the following modifications, namely:-(a) 	any such certificate may be issued in respect of any such ship as in respect of a Bangladesh ship provided that any such certificate issued in respect of a ship of one hundred and fifty tons gross or upwards belonging to a country to which the Load Line Convention applies shall only be valid so long as the ship is not plying on voyages from or to any port or place in Bangladesh to or from any port or place outside Bangladesh, and shall be endorsed with a statement to that effect and shall be cancelled by the Government if it has reason to believe that the ship is so plying; and(b) 	the survey required for the purpose of seeing whether the certificate should remain in force shall take place when required by the Government.(2) If the Government is satisfied-(a) 	that provision has been made for the fixing, marking and certifying of load lines by the law in force in any country outside Bangladesh with respect to ships or any class or description of ship of that country and has also been so made or has been agreed to be so made for recognising Bangladesh Load Line Certificates as having the same effect in ports or places of that country as certificates issued under the said provisions; and(b) 	that the said provision for the fixing, marking and certifying of load lines is based on the same principles as the corresponding provisions of this Part relating to load lines and is equally effective,it may, by notification in the official Gazette, direct that Load Line Certificates issued in pursuance of the said provision or in respect of ships of that class or description of ships of that country, shall have the same effect for the purpose of this Part as Bangladesh Load Line Certificates:Provided that such direction shall not apply to ships of one hundred and fifty tons gross or upwards belonging to countriesto which the Load Line Convention applies, if such ships are engaged in plying on voyages from or to any port or place in Bangladesh to or from any port or place outside Bangladesh.


Section 347:
344. The master of every ship belonging to a country to which the Load Line Convention does not apply shall produce to the Collector of Customs from whom a port clearance for the ship is sought, either a Bangladesh Load Line Certificate or a certificate having effect under this Ordinance as such a certificate, being a certificate for the time being in force in respect of the ship, and port clearance shall not be granted and the ship may be detained until the certificate required by this section is so produced.


Section 348:
345. (1) The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules hereinafter referred to as “the deck cargo rules” prescribing requirements to be complied with where cargo is carried in any uncovered space on the deck of a Bangladesh ship or any other ship within any port or place in Bangladesh; and different requirements may be so prescribed in relation to different descriptions of ships, different descriptions of cargo, different voyages or classes of voyages, different seasons of the year or any other different circumstances.(2) If the load line rules provide, either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases, for assigning special free boards to ships which are to have effect only where a cargo of timber is so carried, then, without prejudice to the generality of the preceding sub section, the deck cargo rules may prescribe special requirements to be complied with in circumstances where any such special free board has effect.(3) If any provision of the deck cargo rules are contravened-(a) 	in the case of a Bangladesh ship, or(b) 	in the case of any other ship while the ship is within any port or at any place in Bangladesh,the master or owner of the ship shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand Taka.(4) Where a person is charged with an offence under the last preceding sub section, it shall be a defence to prove that the contravention was due solely to deviation or delay and that the deviation or delay was caused solely by stress of weather or other circumstances which neither the master nor the owner nor the charterer, if any, could have prevented or forestalled.(5) For the purpose of securing compliance with the deck cargo rules, any Surveyor authorised in that behalf by the Government may inspect any ship which is carrying cargo in any uncovered space on her deck.


Section 349:
346. (1) If any ship, either Bangladesh or foreign, other than a coasting ship or home trade ship, carries as deck cargo, that is to say, in any uncovered space upon deck, or in any covered space not included in the cubical contents forming the ship's registered tonnage, and not exempted by regulations under this Ordinance, timber, stores or other goods, all dues payable on the ship's tonnage shall be payable as if there were added to the ship's registered tonnage, the tonnage of the space occupied by those goods at the time at which the goods become payable.(2) The space so occupied shall be deemed to be the space limited by the area occupied by the goods and by straight lines enclosing a rectangular space sufficient to include the goods.(3) The tonnage of the space shall, for the purpose of this section, be ascertained by an officer of the Customs and when so ascertained shall be entered by him in a memorandum which he shall deliver to the master, and the master shall, when the said dues are demanded, produce that memorandum in like manner as if it were the certificate of registry, or, in the case of a foreign ship, the document equivalent to a certificate of registry, and in default, shall be liable to pay the same penalty as if he had failed to produce the said certificate or document.


Section 350:
347. (1) The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for regulating, in the interests of safety, the carriage of dangerous goods in ships, or adopt, with or without modification, any rules, regulations or codes relating to the carriage of such goods made by any other country or any international organisation and the provisions of the rules, regulations or codes so adopted shall have effect as if they were rules made under this sub section.(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for the classification of such goods, the packing, marking and stowing of such goods or any class of such goods, and the fixing of the maximum quantity of any such class of goods which may be carried in different ships or classes of ships.(3) The owner, master or agent of a ship carrying or intending to carry any dangerous goods as cargo and about to make a voyage from a port or place in Bangladesh shall furnish in advance the prescribed particulars of the ship and the cargo to the Principal Officer or to such other officer as may be specified for the purpose.(4) A Surveyor may inspect the ship for the purpose of ensuring that the rules made under this section are complied with.(5) If any of the rules made under this section is not complied with in relation to any ship, the owner or master of the ship shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to twenty thousand Taka, or with both, and the ship shall be deemed for purposes of this Part to be an unsafe ship.Explanation.  In this section, the expression “dangerous goods” means goods which by reason of the nature, quantity or mode of stowage are either singly or collectively liable to endanger the life or the health of person on or near the ship or to imperil the ship, and includes all substances within the meaning of the expression “explosives” as defined in theExplosives Act, 1884(IV of 1884), and any other goods which the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify as dangerous goods, but shall not include any fog or distress signals or like equipment required to be carried by the ship under this Ordinance or the rules or regulations made thereunder.


Section 351:
348. (1) Where grain is loaded on board any Bangladesh ship or is loaded on board any ship within any port or place in Bangladesh, all necessary and reasonable precautions shall be taken to prevent the grain from shifting; and if such precautions are not taken, the owner or the master of the ship or any agent of the owner who was charged with the loading or with sending the ship to sea laden with grain shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand Taka, and the ship shall be deemed for the purposes of this Part to be unsafe by reason of improper loading.(2) Where any ship which is loaded with grain outside Bangladesh without all necessary and reasonable precautions having been taken to prevent the grain from shifting, enters any port or place in Bangladesh so laden, the owners or the master of the ship shall be punishable with fine which may extend to Taka ten thousand, and the ship shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be unsafe by reason of improper loading:Provided that this sub section shall not apply to a ship which would not have entered any such port or place but for stress of weather or any other circumstances that neither the master nor the owner nor the charterer, if any, could have prevented or forestalled.(3) On the arrival at a port or place in Bangladesh from a port or place outside Bangladesh of any ship carrying a cargo of grain, the master shall cause to be delivered at the office of the Principal Officer or to such other officer as may be specified by the Government in this behalf, a notice stating-(a) the draught of water and free board of the said ship after the loading of the cargo was completed at the final port of loading; and(b) the following particulars of the grain carried, namely:(i) the kind of grain and quantity thereof stated in cubic feet, quarters, bushels or tons weight;(ii) the mode in which the grain is stowed; and(iii) the precautions taken to prevent the grain from shifting.(4) If the master fails to deliver the notice required by sub section (3), or if in any such notice makes any statement that he knows it to be false in a material particular, or recklessly makes a statement that is false in a material particular, he shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand Taka.(5) A Surveyor or any other person authorised in this behalf by general or special order of the Government may, for securing the observance of the provisions of this section, inspect a ship carrying a cargo of grain and the mode in which such cargo is stowed therein.(6) The Government may make rules prescribing in relation to loading of ships generally or of ships of any class the precautions to be taken, and when such precautions have been prescribed, they shall be treated for the purposes of this section to be included in the expression “necessary and reasonable precautions”.(7) In this section, the expression “grain” includes wheat, maize, oats, rye, barley, rice, pulses and seeds and processed forms thereof whose behaviour is similar to that of grain in its natural state.

Section 354:
351. (1) Every person who sends or attempts to send a Bangladesh ship to sea from any port or place in Bangladesh in such an unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered shall, unless he proves that he used all reasonable means to ensure her being sent to sea in a seaworthy state, or that her going to sea in such an unseaworthy state was under the circumstances reasonable and justifiable, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to forty thousand Taka, or with both.(2) Every master of a Bangladesh ship who knowingly takes such ship to sea in such unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered shall, unless he proves that her going to sea in such unseaworthy state was, under the circumstances reasonable and justifiable, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to forty thousand Taka, or with both.(3) For the purpose of giving such proof, every person charged under this section may give evidence in the same manner as any other witness.(4) No prosecution under this section shall be instituted except by, or with the consent of, the Government.


Section 355:
352. (1) In every contract of service, express or implied, between the owner of a Bangladesh ship and the master or any seaman thereof, and in every contract of apprenticeship whereby any person is bound to serve as an apprentice on board any such ship, there shall be implied, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, an obligation on the owner that such owner and the master, and every agent charged with the loading of such ship or the preparing thereof for sea, or the sending thereof to sea, shall use all reasonable means to ensure the seaworthiness of such ship for the voyage at the time when such voyage commences, and to keep her in a seaworthy state during the voyage.(2) For the purpose of seeing that the provisions of this section have been complied with, the Government may, either at the request of the owner or otherwise, arrange for a survey of the hull, equipment or machinery of any sea-going ship by a Surveyor.


Section 356:
353. (1) Where a Bangladesh ship in any port or place to which the Government may specially extend this section is an unsafe ship, that is to say, is by reason of the defective condition of her hull, equipment or machinery, or by reason of under-manning or by reason of overloading or improper loading, unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life, having regard to the nature of the service for which she is intended, such ship may be provisionally detained for the purpose of being surveyed or for ascertaining the sufficiency of her crew and either finally detained or released as follows, namely:-(a) 	the Government, if it has reason to believe, on complaint or otherwise, that any such ship is unsafe, may order the ship to be provisionally detained as an unsafe ship for the purpose of being surveyed;(b) 	a written statement of the grounds of such detention shall be forthwith served on the master of such ship;(c) 	when the Government orders that a ship be provisionally detained, it shall either refer the matter to the Court of Survey for the Port where the ship is detained, or forthwith appoint some competent person to survey such ship and report thereon; and, on receiving the report, may either order the ship to be released or, if in its opinion the ship is unsafe, may order her to be finally detained, either absolutely or until the performance of such conditions with respect to the execution of repairs or alterations, or the unloading or reloading of cargo, as the Government thinks necessary for the protection of human life;(d) 	before an order for final detention is made, a copy of the report shall be served upon the master of the ship, and within seven days after such service, the owner or master may appeal against such report, in the manner prescribed, to the Court of Survey for the port where the ship is detained;(e) 	where a ship has been provisionally detained and a person has been appointed under this section to survey such ship, the owner or master of the ship, at any time before such person makes that survey, may require that he shall take with him as assessor such person as the owner or master may select, being a person named in the list of assessors for the Court of Survey or, if there is no such list, or if it is impracticable to procure the attendance of any person named in such list, a person of nautical, engineering or other special skill and experience; if the Surveyor and assessor agree that the ship should be detained or released, the Government shall cause the ship to be detained or released accordingly, and the owner or master shall have no right of appeal; if the Surveyor and assessor differ in their report, the Government may act as if the requisition had not been made, and the owner or master shall have a right of such appeal touching the report of the Surveyor as is hereinbefore provided in this section;(f) 	where a ship has been provisionally detained, the Government may, at any time, if it thinks fit expedient, refer the matter to the Court of Survey for the port where the ship is detained; and(g) 	the Government may, at any time, if satisfied that a ship detained under this section is not unsafe, order her to be released either with or without any conditions.(2) A Principal Officer or any other person appointed by the Government for the purpose, in this Ordinance referred to as a Detaining Officer, shall have the same power as the Government has under this section of ordering that a ship be provisionally detained for the purpose of being surveyed, and of appointing a person to survey her; and, if he thinks that a ship so detained by him is not unsafe, a Detaining Officer may order her to be released.(3) A Detaining Officer shall forthwith report to the Government any order made by him for the detention or release of a ship.(4) A ship detained under this section shall not be released by reason of her ceasing to be a Bangladesh ship subsequent to her detention.(5) A Detaining Officer may, for the purpose of this Part,-(a) 	go on board any ship and may inspect the same or any part thereof, or any of the machinery, equipment and cargo on board thereof, and require the unloading or removal of any cargo, ballast or tackle, not unnecessarily detaining or delaying her from discharging, unloading or proceeding on any voyage;(b) 	by summons under his hand, require the attendance of all such persons as he thinks fit to call before him, examine such persons, and, by a like summons, require returns in writing to any inquiries he thinks fit to make;(c) 	require and enforce the production of all books, papers or documents which he considers important; and(d) 	administer oaths, or, in lieu of administering an oath, require every person examined by him to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of the statements made by him in his examination.
